# Godot VR Wave Shooter Tutorial

* We are going to make [this game](https://electronstudio.github.io/godot_vr_wave_shooter/).  Click the link to play it now.

* The starter project contains quite a lot of my code already.  It's not difficult to make a FPS game in Godot, so why do we need this additional code? It's because the game is going to work in VR.  Most importantly, it will work on PC VR, Oculus Quest and Google Cardboard.  And it will work for players who don't have VR too.  This is a little tricky to get right, which is why I have already supplied all the code to move the player around.  You can also use this project as the basis for a third person view game by just setting the VR player not to be able to move.

## Getting started

Download [this stater project](godot_racing_starter.zip), unzip and import it into Godot.
